            When Alberto announced to his parents that he wanted to be a chef,
            his father sent him to peel potatoes at a friend's tavern. His goal
            was to discourage him. The result was Alberto proving to both
            himself and others that he was born to be a chef.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proud Potato Peeler was born as a brand that honours that moment:
            the point in time when he realised his calling and chose to chase
            it. Every dish is rooted in that playful mix of grit, warmth, and
            a touch of nostalgia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Alberto's journey has taken him through award-winning
            kitchens across Europe. Proud Potato Peeler brings those stories
            back to the table&nbsp;&mdash; in a space where friends gather,
            conversations linger, and every plate is made with a whole lot of
            heart.
