            The kitchen is Alberto's natural habitat. It is where he sets loose and creates whatever he has envisioned — any idea that has inspired him and any gustatory experience he wishes to give according his hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his extroverted personality craves companionship, sharing, and connection. Alberto's cooking is an act of giving, of bringing people closer to himself and others. The ambience he creates is reminiscent of a spontaneous family gathering, with the typical intimacy between people sharing a common, pleasant and impromptu experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is because food has brought people together from the beginning of time, satisfying not just the basic need for survival, but also the need for connection.
