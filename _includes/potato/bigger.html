          When someone is passionate about something, they always want to feed that passion through evolution. And what truly defines Proud Potato Peeler is his passion for providing dining experiences of furthering and broadening horizons; experiences of yet another level. The very steps which 14-year-old Alberto took when he found his calling have led him to his true destination.

          This is where he delivers the promise that he has made to himself and his guests: that the food he prepares will always be a novel experience imbued in the same passion. Proud Potato Peeler takes the next step: relocating to a new, larger space, where guests can still enjoy communal dining, a shared experience in a welcoming environment, and where the chef himself cooks the dishes in plain sight. Although the canvas may have grown larger, accommodating all sorts of events, the ambience remains homey and intimate with the signature style of Proud Potato Peeler. Alberto is omnipresent, and his guests enjoy the same loving care as the food that he serves.
        </p>

          It is thanks to this dream that Alberto Similides is a talented chef with a globe-trotting career through award-winning restaurants, which has taken him all the way from Cyprus, Athens, and Berlin to cosmopolitan Singapore.
