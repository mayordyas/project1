            When Alberto announced to his parents that he wanted to be a chef, his father sent him to peel potatoes at a friend's tavern. His goal was to discourage him. The result was Alberto proving to both himself and others that he was born to be a chef. And this is how Proud Potato Peeler was born &mdash; a brand that, rather than denouncing Alberto's origins, actually honours the moment that shaped him, the moment that affirmed his dream.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is thanks to this dream that Alberto Similides is a talented chef with a globe-trotting career through award-winning restaurants, which has taken him all the way from Cyprus, Athens, and Berlin to cosmopolitan Singapore.
